Service Mapping Analysis Completed

1. Methodology: Performed service version detection using nmap -sV to fingerprint application headers and protocol responses.

2. Service Inventory: We have successfully mapped services to all discovered open ports.

Remote Access: OpenSSH 8.9p1 (Standard across all nodes)

Orchestration: HashiCorp Consul Agent (Port 8500) identified on multiple nodes, indicating active service discovery.

Storage: MinIO Object Storage (Ports 9000/9001) detected on Storage Node.

Web/Proxy:

OpenResty (Nginx fork) handling ingress on Ports 80/443.

Uvicorn (ASGI) handling Python application traffic on high ports (6001, 8000).

Database: Redis (Port 9111) detected.

3. Risk Note: Redis (9111) and Consul (8500) provide detailed version info. Ensure ACLs are in place to prevent unauthenticated access.
